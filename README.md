# MOOCs
A list of all the certificates I have earned from Online MOOCs on Coursera and edX

My legal name in India is Yadugiri Saikumar. In my state, Telangana, in India, our family name appears first in all of our certificates. I have stuck to that for the past decade. Only now, I am writing my family name as my last name. This is why all the certificates have my last name first.
